Hello! My name is [**Damirdine**](mailto:damirdine@outlook.fr), and I'm a _JavaScript/PHP_ developer currently based in **France**. I have always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I enjoy working on challenging projects that allow me to learn and grow.

I am currently pursuing an alternate training program with [Edumiam](https://www.edumiam.com/) and [Oclock](https://oclock.io/alternance-pro) since december 2022, where I am learning the skills necessary to become a Software Engineer. Prior to this, I completed a three-month [POEC](https://lamanu.fr/formation-developpeur-php/) training program in Front-End/PHP Development in 2021 with [LaManu](https://lamanu.fr/formation-developpeur-php/), which helped solidify my interest in pursuing a career in web development. I also completed a developer training program with [Afpa](https://www.afpa.fr/formation-qualifiante/developpeur-web-et-web-mobile) to further enhance my skills in 2022.

In addition to my formal training, I am constantly learning and improving my skills through self-study.

I am a detail-oriented individual who enjoys collaborating with others and finding creative solutions to complex problems. In my free time, I like to work on personal projects and learn new technologies.

## Tech Stack

What matters the most to me is delivering value to the end user. While I'm more comfortable with the JavaScript ecosystem, I'm equally at ease with PHP and its two frameworks, Laravel and Symfony.

Here are some of the technologies I've worked with:

- **JavaScript**: _Node.js, React.js, Vue.js_
- **PHP**: _Laravel, Symfony_
- **Database**: _PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB_
- **Design**: _Figma_
- **Tools**: _Git, Docker, Visual Studio Code, GitHub_

In my current training, I'm learning to _develop mobile apps using Flutter_, and I'm also continuing to educate myself on _software design principles_.
Currently, I am exploring Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management system.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these technologies or if you have any questions!
